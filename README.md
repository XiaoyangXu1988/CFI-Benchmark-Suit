# CFI-Benchmark-Suite
This benchmark suite is aiming to facilitate researchers to evaluate their CFI (Contorl Flow Integrity) or SFI (Software Fault Isolation) systems. Researchers have been proposed various novelty works on these lines of research, while no CFI/SFI oriented benchmark is available. Researchers mostly leverage SPEC CPU Benchmark to evaluate their systems. These assessments are limited to runtime overhead. Therefore, our CFI Benchmark Suite strives for gauging CFI/SFI systems' performance, compatibility, and security.\
The suite consists of a bunch of programs that are challenging for CFI/SFI deployment. They reflect some obscure features of real-world x86 COTS binaries generated by arbitrary compilers.
- [CODE-COOP](./codecoop.cpp)\
`COnfused DEputy-assisted Counterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (CODE-COOP) attacks turn recipients of counterfeit objects into confused deputies who unwittingly invoke policy-prohibited code on behalf of callers.`
- [function pointers](./fptr.cpp)
- [function pointer in PE header (win only)](./TLScallback.cpp)
- [import address table](./IATcall.cpp)
- [multi-threading](./multithreading.cpp)
- [ret instruction](./ret.cpp)
- [structured exception handling](./seh.cpp)
- [tail call](./tailcall.cpp)
